Target Profile:
	This cv is not really intended to be used for future job applications as it isn't really a good CV. It's more intended on academical purposes, as learning how to develop html and css files properly. 
	It's very simple and concise and it contains the minimun necessary information to the reader. So I'd consider it as a main public focused CV.


Information Architecture
	The architecture of the CV is quite simple we have an html file with a header, a central main-body part and an aside part. This is not quite clear when seeing it, as the final design is divided into 3
	columns, one for each aprt, as I thought it would be the best way to get a clear vision of the CV. It is based onn my real CV but I finally made lots ot modificationns to make it look different.

Visual design
	The design of the CV is quite simple. we have the information divided in 3 columns (personal information, job-related aspects of interest and knowledge/past jobs). It has a wave-form background image 
	that decorates the whole file and I think everything is pretty clear and concise to the eye of the reader.
